# Monsoon Frontend Boilerplate
Boilerplate for monsoon Webapps

### What is this repo?

This repo is a ready to develop React/Redux/Saga app with a Koa.js server configured to serve the js/html/css bundled by Webpack 2.

### How should I use this repo?

You should pull it down, take a look at the architecture and start expanding it to meet you need IN A NEW REPO OR A NEW BRANCH.

If you make a substratal change to the way the frontend works and want it to become the new standard, include the change in a new branch or merge it to development/master

### How do I get started?

  `git clone https://github.com/augustinevt/monsoon-boiler.git`

  `npm i`

  `npm start`

  optionally, you can run the server too

### How do I deploy?

  Refer to the /docs folder. There will be a file there dedicated to explaining and guiding you through the deployment process.

### Who do I contact for help?
  Whoever is leading the development of the frontend architecture at Monsoon.
  Currently that's me!
